# Graph (grid)

  
Our project is on grid graphs. It was done as part of the 2021-2022 LIFAP6 teaching unit.

 

## Archive Organization

  

**. / :** Contains the Makefile to compile the project by creating two executables contained in the bin folder.

**bin/ :** Contains the main and mainTest executables.

**data/ :** All files (.txt) containing graph information.

**obj/ :** Object files (.o): main. o, mainTest. o, Graph.o.

**src/ :** Source files . cpp and header . h: Graphe.cpp, Graphe. h, main.cpp, mainTest.cpp.


## Usage and Executables


To compile and create executables, we use the make command in the Linux terminal followed by . /bin/ExecuteName from the folder.

Our project contains two executables:

- main: executable to create either a graph manually by choosing the height, width and altitudes of each peak or a graph from a file. It is then possible to choose the type of distance calculation (2D or 3D) and if you want to activate the chatd mode. You must then choose the departure and destination index for the A* algorithm.

- mainTest: executable to test the functions of the graph class.
  

## Module

- Top: type corresponding to a top of a graph.

- Graph: class which corresponds to a graph.
